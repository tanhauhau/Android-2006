Server Side code is written in Python 2.7.9 using Python Django Framework 1.7.5 (see more https://www.djangoproject.com). 

To start the server, see
1. Installation
1.1. Installation of Python 2.7.x (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
1.2. Installation of Django (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/topics/install/)
1.3. Installation of pytz (http://pytz.sourceforge.net)

2. Rebuilding the database (optional)
2.1 The database used is SQLite3, it is filled with data we used to tested with our APP,
    to remove all the data and start with a new copy of the database, follow the 
    following steps
2.2 Open terminal, CD to PATH/TO/CURRENT/DIR/server2006
2.3 Delete db.sqlite3
2.4 Open server2006/settings.py, under INSTALLED_APPS, comment out 
	    “… 'clinic', 
	    'doctor',
	    'patient',
	    'appointment',
	    'location',
	    'server2006',
	    'api’,”
    and save the settings.py
2.5 Back to the directory with the file manage.py, run “python manage.py migrate”
2.6 Open server2006/settings.py, uncomment out the part commented in step 2.4
2.7 Back to the directory with the file manage.py, run “python manage.py migrate” again
2.8 Run “python manage.py syncdb”
2.9 Create admin when prompt to create admin, the admin particulars is the same admin used 
    in our Android APP

3. Start the server
3.1 To start server, run “python manage.py runserver <IP_ADDRESS>:<PORT_NUMBER>
3.2 IP_ADDRESS can be found via “ifconfig” in linux or “ipconfig” in windows
3.3 Server will start immediately

4. Update to Android APP
4.1 Currently, we have not yet upload our code to a server with a domain name, therefore,
    we need to manually update the server ip address in our code accordingly.
4.2 Remember to IP_ADDRESS and the PORT_NUMBER used in step 3.1, 
    go to MLTeam1/Code/app/src/main/java/com/ce2006/project/server/Request.java, 
    in the Request class, change the host of the private static variable, host,
    to “<IP_ADDRESS>:<PORT_NUMBER>”
4.3 Rebuild the APP

5. Working Web-based APP (Optional)
5.1 In the browser, you can browse our web-based app via <IP_ADDRESS>:<PORT_NUMBER>

6. Stop the server
6.1 In the terminal, Press <Ctrl>+C to end the server.
